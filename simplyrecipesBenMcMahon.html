                1. Make the focaccia dough
            <p>
                In a medium-sized mixing bowl, or in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, mix together all
                the dough ingredients until the flour is fully absorbed. You don't need to actually knead the
                dough, though I sometimes knead it a few times in the bowl when mixing by hand to incorporate
                the last of the flour...
